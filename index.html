      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I built a computer from components I bought online when I was 14 and taught myself how to use Linux (Debian) and how to code. I still use the behemoth of a case from that computer for my gaming PC, though I have upgraded every component since then. I've been out of the coding game for over a decade and am excited to learn all the new technologies that have come about.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Overland Park, Kansas, which is a suburb of Kansas City.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Sci-fi shows (currently Stargate), gaming, cooking vegan meals, and being a partner in raising my infant son.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Remote work as a web or software developer for 4 days a week so I have more time with my family.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Northern Seattle, in the Broadview neighborhood. My wife and I are renting part of a house from a friend's dad. It's a good situation for saving money for a down-payment on a house!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always wanted to be one, and I was for a few years during university. Especially now with a new addition to our family, I'm looking to put my passion for coding to good use and make a higher salary than I currently do so I can provide more for my family.</p>
